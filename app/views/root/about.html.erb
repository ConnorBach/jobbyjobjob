      <h4>Welcome to Jobby Job Job!</h4>
      My name is Will Wilimek. I created this site to
      aggregate remote developer jobs so I wouldn't have to use 4 different job
      boards when I'm looking for interesting jobs or projects. I also wanted
      to help people find job and use this project as an example of my experience
      working with Ruby/Rails since most of my code is owned by a company and
      can't be released.
      <br><br>
      The site is currently hosted on heroku (free). It uses a postgres backend database and
      a scheduler job to populate jobs every hour from various job boards.
